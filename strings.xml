    <string name="h_tip1">Set your favorite pair of cozy socks by the door, and throw them on when you first return home, as feet retain little heat on their own.</string>
    <string name="h_tip2">Getting ready to catch some zzz\'s? Take a minute to draw the blinds, which act like a blanket for your house.</string>
    <string name="h_tip3">Grab a cup of cocoa or cinnamon tea, turn on some Nat King Cole, and enjoy some good company and winter spirit tonight! A gas stove is actually the most efficient way to boil the water, and electric kettles are good too.</string>
    <string name="h_tip4">Spontaneous week-end getaway? Sounds dope. Adjust the thermostat to 55 deg F on your way out the door.</string>
    <string name="h_tip5">We humans sleep better at temperatures between 61 and 65 deg F. Either manually or set thermostat to automatically reduce temperatures as you wind down to bed.</string>
    <string name="h_tip6">Beanies are a worthy investment.</string>
    <string name="h_tip7"> If radiators are located near cold outside walls, place a sheet of
aluminum foil between the radiator and the wall to reflect heat
back into the room</string>
    <string name="h_tip8">The warmest air in a room will rise to the ceiling. Turning a ceiling fan on at low speeds will actually make the air feel warmer without any additional heating.</string>

    <string name="c_tip1">If using window units, install your AC in a shady location. This will make you cool and efficient. Who doesn\'t want that?</string>
    <string name="c_tip2">Buy an easy-to-drink, spill-proof water bottle and keep it filled with iced water. One 24oz bottle of ice water will instantly provide relief from the summer heat.</string>
    <string name="c_tip3">Are you a guy? Well us women actually prefer room temperatures of about 5 deg F warmer, so turn down the AC if women are visiting. Thanks from all of us.</string>
    <string name="c_tip4">Take a cool shower in the morning. This has been shown to help wake you up when caffeine is out of reach. Saving of cooling and water heating bills too? Cool stuff.</string>
    <string name="c_tip5">Operate your stove, oven, dishwasher and clothes dryer in the
morning or evening when it\â€™s cooler outside. They add extra
heat to your home and make your air conditioner work harder</string>
    <string name="c_tip6">Hitting the road? Driving with the windows down in place of air conditioning when below 40 mph can bring in big energy savings.</string>
    <string name="c_tip7"> Set the air conditioning thermostat at 78 degrees during the
day when home and higher when away</string>
